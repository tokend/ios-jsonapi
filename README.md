# DLJSONAPI

Swift JSONAPI implementation.
Current implementation is based on Aron Balog's [Vox](https://github.com/aronbalog/Vox) library.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

DLJSONAPI is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'DLJSONAPI'
```

DLJSONAPI uses its own pod spec repository. In order to setup it perform once in Terminal:

```ruby
pod repo add ios-specs 'git@github.com:tokend/ios-specs.git'
```
